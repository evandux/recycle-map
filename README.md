# recycle-map
Personal project to map all recycling stations in Kimberley, BC

I have created this project for two reasons:

1. To further my personal understanding of github / git and,
2. Map all recycling stations in Kimberley, British Columbia which exist but are currently difficult to find if you are new to town.

# Note 
This will only work if you fill in the fields for your mapbox account credentials.
